# TourProject
Walking tour project written in java

This is the source code of a team assignment for the Discrete Sturctures and Algorithms Module of the Software Development Course in Institute of Technology Carlow.

The assignment was to be completed using a command line program written in java and a text file containing the information for the tour.

This assignment is an excellent demonstration of an Adjacency Matrix and using algorithms to traverse the matrix.

Below is the description of the problem.

For this assignment we were asked to implement a data store of tourist sites within a location of our choice, which will be used by a walking tour group.
Each piece of data stored will contain the name of the site and the co-ordinates of it – expressed as x/y co-ordinates or longitude/latitude co-ordinates. The file should also store for each site, its adjacent sites and the distance between them.
A menu driven application initially allows the user to import a graph from a file using a structure of our choice. This will give the user the option to execute.
The application will allow the user to search for sites by name. It will be able to output sites which are connected and the closest to a given site.
Added to this brief we are required to include one extra operation in our application which must be suitable and useful for our application.

The following operations must be included in this task
•	Open and input a graph from an external file
•	Search for a site
•	Insert and search for an edge
•	Given a site, display all sites connected to it
•	Given a site, display the closet site to it
•	Plus, our extra operation which is allowing the program to select a random site for you to start from.
